FastRead  
Fun little speed reading app that that gives you the optimal maximum reading speed by flashing words by so you eliminate time spent on eye movement while reading.  
Just a fun little personal app I made so I could read research papers at Uni faster than others.  
Customize text size, text centering & font and background colors.  
I also considerred adding full page reading mode with darkened word first half which also maximizes reading speed & text to speech, but found other apps to meet such needs.
