FastRead  
Fun little speed reading app that gives you the optimal maximum reading speed by flashing words, so you eliminate time spent on eye movement while reading.  
Just a fun little personal app I made so I could read research papers at Uni faster than others.  
Customize text size, and text centering, & font, and background colors.  
I also considered adding a full page reading mode with a darkened first half of the word, which also maximizes reading speed, and text-to-speech, but found other methods to meet such needs.
