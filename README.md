FastRead  
Fun little spered reading app that flashes words by so you eliminate time spent on eye movement while reading.  
Just a fun little personal app I made so I could read papers at Uni faster than others.  
Customize text size, centering and font and background colors.  
I also considerred adding full page reading mode with darkened word first half which also maximizes reading speed & text to speech, but found other apps to meet such needs.
